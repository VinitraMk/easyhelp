          <p>Since I was alone, I coded the whole project. For the most part, frontend was done by Bootstrap, but handled the backend on
          my own.</p>

          <p>Small Medium businesses have a limited budget. So there is little money invested in customer engagement. Customer engagement could go a long way to increase and improve the business. Hence a low-cost solution to increase customer engagement becomes imperative. This project aims to provide SMBs a comprehensive and cost-effective solution to the above problem, so a common man running a SMB can improve his business without having to employ more people for the same purpose. 
One of the main objectives of this project are to improve customer engagement continually by improving help through this channel and understand their needs and demands. Another is to get a get a measurable and reliable understanding of how  the clients feel about the services provided to them</p>
          <p>This project has been uploaded in my <a=href="https://github.com/VinitraMk/easyhelp">Github Repo</a>. Feel free to look through it
          and give suggestions and contributions. It will be most appreciated. </p>
